# PythonMusicPlayer
Simple Python music player implemented with different GUI and audio libraries

<h1>Simple Python Audio Player</h1>

<p>
Given the upcoming Sound & Audio Code Jam, I've decided to explore different ways of creating an MP3 player with Python.
<br>
There are pros and cons to every approach and I'll be loading more files into this repository as time goes by
<br>
My goal is to find the most simple implementation as well as the mostg efficient one
